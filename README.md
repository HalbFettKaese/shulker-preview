If you download dark mode, it must be equipped above the regular resource pack.

### How to use
1. Download the data pack and resource pack for your Minecraft version.
2. Select your world in-game and click `Edit`, then `Open World Folder`.
3. Drag the datapack zip from your `Downloads` folder to the `datapacks` folder in your world.
4. Go to the resource packs menu and click `Open Resource Pack Folder`.
5. Drag the resource pack zip from your `Downloads` folder to the resource packs folder.
6. Equip the resource pack.
7. If you also downloaded the dark mode pack, equip it above the normal pack.
8. Enter your world and enjoy!

### FAQ
* Does this work with Spigot/Bukkit/Paper?
   * No. These server softwares break a vanilla command behavior this pack relies on, which I cannot work around. It causes all tooltips to be blank.
* Does this work with Optifine?
   * Yes.
* Does this work with other resource packs?
   * Yes, but the icons inside of shulker boxes will use vanilla textures. Also, another pack that also overrides private use characters will conflict with this one.
* What happens if players don't have the resource pack?
   * They will see the vanilla shulker box tooltip, though it may contain a few blank lines.
* It's not working for me!
   * Feel free to message me on twitter ([@tryashtar](https://twitter.com/tryashtar)) or discord (@tryashtar#7885) and I will be happy to help.
