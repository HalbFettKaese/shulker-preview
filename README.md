If you download dark mode, it must be equipped above the regular resource pack.

2. Select your world in-game and click `Edit`, then `Open World Folder`.
3. Drag the datapack zip from your `Downloads` folder to the `datapacks` folder in your world.
4. Go to the resource packs menu and click `Open Resource Pack Folder`.
5. Drag the resource pack zip from your `Downloads` folder to the resource packs folder.
6. Equip the resource pack.
7. If you also downloaded the dark mode pack, equip it above the normal pack.
8. Enter your world and enjoy!

### FAQ
* Does this work with Spigot/Bukkit/Paper?
   * No. These server softwares break a vanilla command behavior this pack relies on, which I cannot work around. It causes all tooltips to be blank.
* Does this work with Optifine?
   * Yes.
* Does this work with other resource packs?
   * In 1.16 and later, items in the preview will look as they do in your personal resource pack, but blocks will appear with vanilla textures.
   * In 1.15 and earlier, both items and blocks will use vanilla textures. Also, the pack may conflict with other packs that override private use characters.
* What happens if players don't have the resource pack?
   * They will see the vanilla shulker box tooltip, though it may contain a few blank lines.
* It's not working for me!
